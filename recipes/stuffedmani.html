            Large tube pasta are boiled until al dente then a filling of ricotta, mozzarella and sometimes spinach is stuffed inside.
            The filled manicotti shells are layered into a baking dish and covered with marinara sauce.
            Sometimes you’ll see them finished with more cheese over the top...
            This mostly from scratch dish is total comfort food!
            Try them and you’ll see why, so much cheesy, tomatoey deliciousness in every bite!
